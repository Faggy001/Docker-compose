	  	<p>Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening, This website is designed to present our background, highlight our skills, and connect with like-minded individuals and professionals. 
            It's built using HTML5, CSS3, and powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The layout is responsive, meaning it looks great on both desktops and mobile devices.

           My journey into DevOps began with a deep curiosity about how modern software systems operate seamlessly at scale.
           What started as an interest in automating routine tasks soon evolved into a full-fledged commitment to bridging the gap between development and operations. Along the way,
           I have gained hands-on experience with key tools and practices such as CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform, containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
           I’ve deployed and managed secure, scalable environments on AWS, embracing a cloud-first mindset and leveraging services like EC2, S3, RDS, and VPC. More than just mastering tools, DevOps has taught me the value of collaboration, continuous improvement, and resilience in the face of complexity. 
           My goal is to build systems that are not only functional but also scalable, secure, and maintainable — systems that empower teams to deliver software faster, safer, and with confidence.
